# admin-dashboard

This is my **8th project** while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

A responsive **Admin Dashboard layout** built using only **HTML and CSS** — with a strong focus on **CSS Grid** for structuring layout and **Flexbox** where needed.


## 🚀 Features

- Sidebar with icons and navigation links
- Top bar with search bar, user info, and action buttons
- Project cards with links to live preview and code
- Clean UI with custom fonts and color palette
- Built from scratch based on [The Odin Project’s Admin Dashboard design](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
